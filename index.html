	<!-- introduction -->
		<p id="intro">In nature, there is a natural balance of power. This can be expressed by the stark differences between the proud lion and the pitiful sheep. A lion is a prideful, powerful, manipulative, and perceptive animal. Meanwhile, sheep are pitiful, mindless masses that roam our earth meaninglessly acting upon their impulses. In this new world, sheep will perish, and lions will prevail.</p>

		<h3 class="headings">The Imperial Creed</h3>
		<p>

I pledge myself and all I do<br>
Towards advancing humankind, <br>
Though strength and might may show me true,<br>
Greatness lies within the mind.<br><br>

I vow to follow Chaz our God<br>
And support the Imperator’s Reign,<br>
To eliminate the World of Old’s façade<br>
And for inferiority to be slain.<br><br>

I am a Citizen of the World<br>
And will protect It with all my might;<br>
The Empire’s strength will become unfurled<br>
And give the disobedient a fight.<br><br>

I will follow our God.<br>
I will follow our Lord.<br><br>

Knowledge is Eternal.<br>
Long Live the Empire.<br>
</p>
